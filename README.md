At a given depth from Earth's surface, it's known that the ground is chilly in summer, 
but hotter in winter than the surrounding air. Using ground temperature gradients for 
both cooling and heating purposes  
It is thought that ground- to-air heat exchangers are a reasonable choice to warming or cooling 
structures. Metal, plastic, or substantial lines are covered at a specific profundity in the 
earth to serve as conduits. Fans are used to circulate fresh air through the pipes. Inside 
the pipe, heat may be moved from the beginning the air contingent upon the 
temperature differential.
